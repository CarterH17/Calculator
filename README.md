# Calculator
This is my First attempt at creating a repository and uploading my projects to GitHub. I created this calculator app while following along with a youtube videos help. The application can perform basic math functions much like a standard calculator would.
This Introductory project was very useful for refreshing my java knowledge as well as inroducing me to some new java commands in order to creae the interface. This was mostly meant to be a short projet that can be used for me to learn more about github and help get me inolved with the process of creating projects and showing them off. It is my hope that this will be my first of many projects on this site. I now am planning on creating my own application without the help of a tutorial now that I better undestand the use of GitHub.
